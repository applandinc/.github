# Welcome to AppMap

[AppMap](https://appmap.io) is a free and open-source runtime code analysis tool with support for:

[Ruby](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap-ruby)
[Java](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap-java)
[Python](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap-python)
[Javascript](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap-agent-js)

AppMap records code execution traces, collecting information about how your code works and what it does. Then it presents this information as interactive diagrams that you can search and navigate. In the diagrams, you can see exactly how functions, web services, data stores, security, I/O, and dependent services all work together when application code runs.

You use AppMaps right in your code editor, using an AppMap extension or plugin. AppMaps also link directly to code, so you can use the information in the diagrams to make immediate code changes and improvements.

Over 18,000 software developers are using the [AppMap extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=appland.appmap) and the [AppMap for JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16701-appmap).
